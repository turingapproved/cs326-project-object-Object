## User Interactions*

Specfic kinds of data the app uses:

* User's recently viewed drives
* User's recently created drives
* Drive information
* Drive completion
* Requirement information
* Requirement completion

Information is separate from completion becuase information covers things like a requirements name and the quantity it needs total, however the completion is calculated dynamically based on the recoded donations in the database.

**N.B. This is a revised version of user interaction from milestone-2. Most importantly I cut the comment section from the drive page, as well as slightly changing the information displayed with a drive. I did this in order to save time and focus on the core aspects of the app, creating and managing drives. I believe that the data interactions listed above still fulfill the requirements, while also allowing me to finish my project in a reasonable timeframe*

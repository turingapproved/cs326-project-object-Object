## User Interactions*

Initially the users will be faced with a login screen. They are presented with two options: one for shelters, and one for donors. Upon authenticating successfully the user will be brought to a home page that displays a welcome sign. 

If the user is a shelter it will show a text `input` to make a new drive. Beneath that it will show a summary of the past 5(?) drives they have created. 

If the user is a donor it will show a text `input` to search for drives. Beneath that it will show a summary of the past 5(?) drives they have donated to. 

Clicking on one of the drives will bring up that drive's page. This will show the drive name, location, associated shelter, and the list of things they need, along with completion bars.

**N.B. This is a revised subset of user interactions from my initial milestone. I have made this change in order to focus on completing some features rather than stubbing out many. If I find that I have extra time, I may add them back.*
